# WebMyth2 #
A webOS app for controlling a MythTV frontend for both tablets and phones.  The app is written using the enyo framework so it works well in both tablet and phone formats.  It is the successor to the previous WebMyth app based on the older Mojo framework.
MythTV is a very powerful DVR system, but setting up a MythTV system is not a trivial process.  If you are interested in setting up a MythTV system, check out the MythTV Wiki.  http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Main_Page.

## Requirements ##
  * Working MythTV system.
  * Network control interface setup on the frontend(s) you wish to control. http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Telnet_socket
  * An HP TouchPad

## Known Issues ##
  * Music playlists support is limited
  * Videos list by directory not yet implemented
  * Assumes default keymap for use for all frontends

## Planned features in future releases ##
  * Major development for the app is complete, only large bug fixes or compatibility fixes will be done
  * You can see a rough list of possible future improvements here: http://code.google.com/p/webmyth/source/browse/trunk/webmyth/todo.txt

## Getting Help ##
  * If all else fails, you can try shooting me an email to [webmyth.help@gmail.com](mailto:webmyth.help@gmail.com?subject=WebMyth+Support) or contact me on twitter [@webmyth\_dev](http://twitter.com/webmyth_dev).

## Donations ##
  * I don't want any donations myself.  But if you would like to donate you can donate to the WebOS Internals group.  They are a phenomenal group who have done so much for the WebOS community.  I am not personally affiliated with them in any way but think they deserve all the support they can get.  http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/WebOS_Internals:Site_support

**_NOTE:_** WebMyth uses Metrix for some basic analytics.  The analytics are only used to provide basic information on the total number of users for the app and their country of usage.  http://metrix.webosroundup.com/privacy.
The app will not submit any information to Metrix on its first run.  The app will start submitting anonymous information with the second run of the app unless it is specifically disabled in the app's preferences.
